      I’ve had this piece floating around in my head for some time now.
      The general idea is that it’s a funeral sort of piece –
      soft, quiet, sad, but still in a major key for some reason:
      I can’t put it into words, but that just feels right.
      In my head, the melody is sung (solo or choir, not sure), but obviously I can’t do that, so piano it is.
      The first minute or so is the actual piece,
      then I added some improvisation.

      I always thought that I ripped this off from some movie –
      I always think of the scene after Gandalf’s fall in Fellowship of the Ring –
      but I haven’t been able to remember which one,
      and nobody else I’ve played it to seems to recognize it,
      so perhaps it is an original theme that my mind just made up a backstory for.
