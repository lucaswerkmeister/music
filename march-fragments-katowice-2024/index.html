        wrote these “fragments of a march” in January 2020,
        inspired by some other march music I had listened to
        (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Double_Eagle"><i lang="de">Unter dem Doppeladler</i></a>,
        which ContraPoints used in some of her videos and I had previously transcribed <a href="https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/unter-dem-doppeladler/">an arrangement</a> for,
        or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrance_of_the_Gladiators"><i>Entrance of the Gladiators</i></a>).
        It seemed to me that these marches frequently had three distinct parts:
        a beginning with the whole band (“A”),
        a middle part with the low brass instruments taking the lead (“B”),
        and an end in a different key (“C”);
        I had a “B” part and a “C” part in my head, and I wrote them down,
        but a matching “A” part never materialized.
        (These parts probably have real names in music theory –
        a part of me wants to call the “C” part a “trio”? –
        but I don’t know and don’t really care enough to look it up.)
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, I attended Wikimania 2024 in Katowice
        (maybe I’ll write a separate blog post for that later),
        where I was part of the <a href="https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2024:WikiOrchestra">WikiOrchestra</a>;
        this inspired me to record some more music,
        and I figured that I might as well record these fragments of a march.
        Since there should be <em>something</em> to disambiguate them from any other march-like music I might record in future,
        I am dedicating them to Katowice.
        (Naming marches after geographic places feels like a reasonable thing to do;
        compare, say, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Florentiner_March_-_U.S._Air_Force_Band.ogg"><i lang="de">Florentiner Marsch</i></a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the composition,
        I like the “B” part well enough,
        and I’m quite happy with the “C” part:
        I enjoy the way the melody and chords are mixing in the right hand.
        The <i lang="it">accelerando</i> in the bridge between them is a bit annoying,
        but I can’t really help it:
        to my ear, the “C” part needs to be rather faster than the “B” part,
        so we have to get from one to the other somehow –
        unless I eventually write more march parts and can graft these two parts onto other bits with matching tempo.
        (I actually found a fragment of an alternative “C” part in the LilyPond score I had written back in 2020 when I came back to this now,
        but the “B” and “C” part recorded here is what has stuck in my head over the past four years,
        so that’s what I recorded.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the <em>notation</em> of the composition (the PDF / LilyPond below)…
        it’s really not great, but I don’t want to spend too much time perfecting it either.
        I have no idea if the time signature makes sense,
        or if this should be (say) 2/2 time instead of 4/4 time –
        this is something that I never pay much attention to when <em>reading</em> a score,
        but find surprisingly difficult to figure out when <em>writing</em> one.
        But hey, it’s better than nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance isn’t flawless, but it’s good enough –
        if I tried to perfect every recording I upload,
        I would never upload anything,
        so I’m trying to be less obsessive about that.
        A few missed notes are annoying, but I think you can imagine what they’re supposed to be;
        the other major flaw is the tempo:
        even though I had already slowed down compared to some earlier test recordings,
        listening back to it I now think I was still too fast in the “C” part
        (and didn’t even hold a consistent tempo either).
        In my defense, the <i lang="it">accelerando</i> in the bridge
        makes it impossible to play with a metronome 😅
